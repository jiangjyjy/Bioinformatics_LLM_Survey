## üöß Challenges and Future Directions

### Key Challenges
*   **Data Scarcity, Quality, and Bias:** High-quality, annotated biological data is limited, leading to potential model biases.
*   **Computational Complexity:** Training and running state-of-the-art models require massive computational resources, limiting accessibility.
*   **Multimodal Integration:** Biological systems are complex. Current models often focus on a single data type (e.g., only DNA), missing the interactions between different molecular layers.

### Future Directions
*   **Hybrid AI Models:** Integrate LLMs with graph neural networks (GNNs) and knowledge graphs to improve biological reasoning.
*   **Multimodal Learning:** Develop models that can process DNA, RNA, protein, and epigenetic data simultaneously for a more holistic understanding.
*   **Clinical Applications:** Bridge the gap between research and real-world applications by focusing on model validation, regulatory compliance, and ethical considerations.
